To make all the works we did before more complete and well-organized, I will try to revise them and add new things this March.
For each week, I will update one statistical learning method and one R package.
* 【Linear Discriminant Analysis (Add: QDA) + dplyr】: 2/29 - 3/06
* 【Logistic Regression + reshape2】: 3/07 - 3/13
* 【Support Vector Machine + ggplot2】: 3/14 - 3/20
* 【Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting + ggplot2】: 3/21 - 3/27
* 【KNN + stringr】: 3/28 - 4/03
